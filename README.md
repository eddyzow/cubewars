An open-source cloud-based multiplayer game inspired by a familiar stacker. Clear lines in two dimensions, attack your opponents, use epic powerups, and rise in the ranking ladder!

Note: The server-side logic (including matchmaking, database, and anti-cheat mechanisms) is not included in this repository. This will be made public later once I figure out how to keep the integrity of the game safe. For now, I will host the server locally and on Heroku.
